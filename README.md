# 📊 Data Analysis with Pandas & Matplotlib

## 📌 Objective

This project demonstrates how to **load, analyze, and visualize a dataset** using Python libraries such as **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

The assignment covers:

* Loading and cleaning a dataset.
* Performing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Generating useful insights with statistics.
* Creating different visualizations for better understanding.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation & analysis
* **Matplotlib** – visualization library
* **Seaborn** – advanced and beautiful charts

## 🚀 Features Implemented

* Data loading with error handling (`try-except`).
* Checking dataset structure, missing values, and cleaning.
* Descriptive statistics (`mean`, `median`, `std`).
* Grouped analysis by categorical features.
* **4 types of plots**:

  * Line chart (trend over index/time)
  * Bar chart (average comparison by category)
  * Histogram (distribution of numerical feature)
  * Scatter plot (relationship between two numerical features)

## 📈 Outcome

From the analysis, we observed trends, distributions, and relationships between dataset features.
For example, in the **Iris dataset**, **Setosa** has the shortest average petal length, while **Virginica** has the longest.
